# Microphone OpenAI
.NET project which impements a real-time-transcription by using the microphone input for speech-to-text transcription with the OpenAI endpoint [https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions](https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions). Notice, the OpenAI endpoint (non-paid access) only allows up to three transcriptions per minute.
